                <p><b>Jase Messina</b><i> August 20th, 2020</i></p>
                <p><em>Blade Runner 2049</em> is one of my favorite all time movies. I love the cyberpunk subgenre way too much and this movie captures that essence so well. One of my favorite things is this movie technically follows the first movie but goes in a way that doesnt require you to watch the first one from 1982 and still enjoy the movie as a whole. From the action, to the drama, and mystery this movie really does it all so well. Also, <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> has one of the best OST's I have ever heard, the music really adds to every scene so much. This film also has some amazing still pictures to use for wallpapers! </p>
