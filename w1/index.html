    <h1>Jase Messina</h1>

    <p>The <b>scorpion</b> wants to cross a river, but the scorpion can't swim. So the scorpion asks a frog that happens to be by the river if he'd give him a ride on his back, so he can get across. The from asks him <i>"but you'll sting me, won't you?"</i> The scorpion respondes: "I would never do that, because if you die halfway across, <b><u>I'll drown."</u></b> The frog is convinced, and kindly lets the scopion onto his back, and starts across the river, but on the way, the scoprion stings the frog. As he's losing consciousness, the frog says: " you told me you wouldn't sting me." And the scorpion tells him "I couldn't help it, it's a scorpions nature." <b><u>I am the scorpion.</u></b></p>
